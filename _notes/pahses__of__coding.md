Your approach is solid. Here’s how I’d **polish it** so you learn the right system-design lessons without getting lost, and end up with a backend that can power CLI, web (sockets), and a Telegram bot.

# 0) North Star: One Domain Kernel, Many Interfaces

- Build a **pure domain core** (turn engine, map/quests, combat, loot, crafting) with no framework or I/O.
- Expose it behind **ports/adapters (hexagonal/clean architecture)** so you can plug in:

  - CLI adapter (stdin/stdout)
  - Web adapter (HTTP + WebSocket)
  - Telegram adapter (bot webhook)

- This keeps the rules **testable, deterministic, and reusable** when you go multiplayer & microservices.

---

# 1) Phase A — Single-Player “Modular Monolith” (fast, clean, test-first)

**Goal:** a complete loop you can play locally; everything in one repo/process, but **modularized by bounded contexts**.

**Bounded contexts (modules)**

- `Player` (stats, progress)
- `Inventory & Crafting` (items, recipes)
- `World/Map` (node graph, movement rules)
- `Quests/Story` (fixed events, state machine)
- `Combat` (turn resolver)
- `Loot` (tables, rolls)
- `Game Orchestrator` (turn loop, command router)

**Key design choices**

- **CQRS** at module boundaries: commands mutate; queries never do.
- **Event log inside the process** (domain events): `PlayerMoved`, `CombatStarted`, `ItemCrafted`, etc.
- **Determinism**: inject RNG (seedable) for reproducible tests and replays.
- **Persistence**: start with JSON/SQLite, but **hide behind repositories**.
- **Version your content** (map, quests, loot tables) so you can migrate saves later.

**Definition of done (Phase A)**

- Can complete a short game in CLI.
- 80%+ unit coverage for domain; golden-path integration tests.
- Save/load works; replay log can rebuild state.

---

# 2) Phase B — “Authoritative Server” Multiplayer (still monolith, but networked)

**Goal:** add networking & rooms/sessions without splitting services yet.

**What you add**

- **Session/Room manager**: a “game instance” per party.
- **Authoritative turn scheduler**: server decides turn order, validates inputs.
- **Input protocol**: small command schema (`Join`, `MoveToNode`, `Attack`, `UseItem`, `Craft`).
- **Transport**: HTTP for auth + WebSocket for turns/events.
- **Idempotency & de-duplication**: every client command has `commandId`.
- **Reconnection**: resume session by `sessionId` + last acked event number.
- **Cheat prevention**: server ignores illegal moves; clients only render.

**Still reuse** the same domain kernel; network adapters translate messages to domain commands.

**Definition of done (Phase B)**

- Two clients can join the same session, take turns, disconnect/reconnect, and finish a quest.
- Backpressure: if a client lags, the game advances with default/timeout actions.

---

# 3) Phase C — Microservices (gradual extraction: “modular monolith → services”)

**Goal:** learn distributed systems _safely_. Extract the hottest modules first.

**Extraction order (typical)**

1. **Auth/Identity** (JWT/OAuth) — easy split, low coupling.
2. **Player Profile/Progress** (reads are frequent, writes moderate).
3. **Inventory & Crafting** (independent rules, bursty writes).
4. **Combat/Session Engine** (keeps authoritative state; likely stateful).
5. **Quests/Story** (content service + progress tracker).
6. **Loot** (stateless, good as a sidecar or shared lib first).

**Communication patterns**

- **Sync**: HTTP/gRPC for request/response (get inventory, craft).
- **Async**: Event bus (Redis Streams/Kafka) for facts: `PlayerMoved`, `QuestCompleted`, `EnemyDefeated`, `ItemGranted`.
- **Outbox pattern** for reliable event publication from services that write to DBs.

**State choices**

- **Session/Combat**: in-memory + Redis for failover/snapshots.
- **Player/Inventory/Quests**: Postgres (relational fits progress & constraints).
- **Loot tables/content**: versioned JSON in object storage or Postgres JSONB.

**Cross-cutting**

- **Idempotent handlers** (event `eventId` + dedup table).
- **Schema registry & event versioning** (backward compatible).
- **Service contracts**: explicit protobuf/OpenAPI + semver.

**Definition of done (Phase C)**

- Kill one service and the game tolerates it (degraded but not crashed).
- Events observable in a dashboard; latencies monitored.

---

# 4) Phase D — Interfaces (CLI, Web, Telegram) via the same API

- **Do not** fork game logic per interface.
- Build thin adapters:

  - CLI → local or remote API client.
  - Web → REST for lobby, WebSocket for session stream.
  - Telegram → command → API; rendered text; long-press choices as buttons.

- Keep **message schemas identical**; only rendering differs.

---

# 5) Phase E — Production-ish System Design Add-Ons

- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry traces; logs with correlation IDs; metrics (turn duration, queue lag).
- **Rate limiting & quotas**: at the gateway (per token/session).
- **Backups & migrations**: content versions, savefile migration scripts.
- **Config & feature flags**: e.g., enable “map unlocking” behind a flag.
- **Chaos testing**: drop messages, delay handlers; ensure turn engine remains consistent.
- **SLOs**: e.g., 99p turn resolution < 200ms, reconnect success ≥ 99.5%.

---

## What you might be missing / common pitfalls

- **Jumping to microservices too early.** Start as a **modular monolith**; extract only when boundaries are proven in use.
- **Leaky domain core.** Don’t let HTTP/WebSocket types bleed into the domain—use adapters.
- **No deterministic RNG.** Seeded RNG is crucial for replays, tests, and debugging desyncs.
- **No event versioning.** Add `v` fields from day one to events and content.
- **State stored only in memory.** Snapshot combat/session state to Redis periodically; on crash, resume.
- **Client authority.** Keep the server authoritative for moves, rolls, and combat resolution.

---

## Milestone checklist (concise)

1. **Playable single-player CLI** with save/load and replay log.
2. **Authoritative server** hosting a session for 2–4 players with reconnection.
3. **Gateway + 2 extracted services** (Auth, Player) + event bus, with dashboards.
4. **Web client** using the same commands/events as CLI.
5. **Telegram bot** using the same backend; text UI only.

---

## TL;DR

Your plan is right. Tighten it by:

- Building a **pure domain core** with ports/adapters.
- Going **single-player → authoritative multiplayer** in one process.
- **Extracting services gradually** (auth, player, inventory, quests…) with an event bus.
- Keeping **one command/event protocol** for all UIs.

If you want, I can outline the **initial command & event schema** (names, fields, lifecycle) you should commit to in Phase A so you won’t paint yourself into a corner later.
